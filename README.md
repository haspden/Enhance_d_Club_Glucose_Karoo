## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. **Launch the app** from your Karoo's app drawer
2. **Accept the medical disclaimer** (required on first launch)
3. **Configure your Nightscout URL**:
   - Format: `https://yoursubdomain.yourdomain.tld/api/v1/entries/sgv.json`
   - Example: `https://mybloodglucose.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries/sgv.json`
   - Local: `http://127.0.0.1:17580/sgv.json` (for local setups)
4. **Configure API Token** (optional):
   - If your Nightscout server requires authentication
   - Enter your API token in the Settings ‚Üí API Token section
   - The token will be stored securely and visible in the interface
   - Use the toggle to hide the token for privacy if needed

#### **What are Nightscout Tokens?**

Nightscout tokens are authentication credentials that allow secure access to your Nightscout site. They act like a "key" that grants specific permissions to access your glucose data.

#### **When Do You Need a Token?**

**You need a token if:**

- Your Nightscout site is **not publicly accessible** (most common)
- Your site requires authentication to view data
- You want to restrict access to specific users
- Your site uses `AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES` set to `denied`

**You don't need a token if:**

- Your Nightscout site is publicly accessible
- Your site allows anonymous read access
- You're using local xDrip+ without authentication

#### **Creating Nightscout Tokens:**

To create authentication tokens for your Nightscout site, follow the [official Nightscout documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/admin_tools/):

1. **Access Admin Tools**: Click the settings panel (three horizontal bars) in your Nightscout website and select "Admin Tools"
2. **Create Token**: Click "Add New Subject" and choose the appropriate role:
   - **`readable`**: Read-only access (recommended for this app)
   - **`careportal`**: Can view and make treatment entries
   - **`admin`**: Full access
3. **Copy Token**: Use the generated token string for authentication

_Note: If you change your API_SECRET, all tokens will change and need to be updated._

### Nightscout API Sources

The app supports multiple Nightscout data sources:

#### 1. **Nightscout Server** (Cloud-based)

- **URL Format**: `https://yournightscout.com/api/v1/entries/sgv.json`
- **Use Case**: Standard cloud-hosted Nightscout instances
- **Requirements**: Internet connection, valid Nightscout URL
- **Authentication**: Optional API token for secure access
- **Example**: `https://mybloodglucose.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries/sgv.json`

#### 2. **Phone Local Broadcast via Hotspot**

- **URL Format**: `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:17580/sgv.json`
- **Use Case**: xDrip+ or similar apps broadcasting glucose data
- **Requirements**: Phone hotspot enabled, xDrip+ configured for broadcast
- **Auto-detection**: App automatically detects gateway IP when connected to hotspot
- **Example**: `http://192.168.1.1:17580/sgv.json`

#### 3. **Local Karoo Device** (xDrip+ Local)

- **URL Format**: `http://127.0.0.1:17580/sgv.json`
- **Use Case**: xDrip+ running locally on the Karoo device
- **Requirements**: xDrip+ installed and configured on Karoo
- **Benefits**: No internet required, direct local access

### Quick Fill Options

The app provides convenient quick-fill buttons for common setups:

- **Local Web** - `http://127.0.0.1:17580/sgv.json`
- **Hotspot Device** - Auto-detects gateway IP and sets `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:17580/sgv.json`
- **Nightscout** - `https://mynightscout.com/api/v1/entries/sgv.json`

### App Settings

- **Auto Refresh** - Enable automatic data updates
- **Notifications** - Enable status notifications
- **API Token** - Optional authentication token for Nightscout servers
- **Restart App** - Apply configuration changes
