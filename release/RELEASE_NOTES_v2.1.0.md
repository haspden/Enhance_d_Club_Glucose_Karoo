### Creating Nightscout Tokens

#### **What are Nightscout Tokens?**

Nightscout tokens are authentication credentials that allow secure access to your Nightscout site. They act like a "key" that grants specific permissions to access your glucose data.

#### **When Do You Need a Token?**

**You need a token if:**

- Your Nightscout site is **not publicly accessible** (most common)
- Your site requires authentication to view data
- You want to restrict access to specific users
- Your site uses `AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES` set to `denied`

**You don't need a token if:**

- Your Nightscout site is publicly accessible
- Your site allows anonymous read access
- You're using local xDrip+ without authentication

#### **Creating Tokens:**

To create authentication tokens for your Nightscout site, follow the [official Nightscout documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/admin_tools/):

1. **Access Admin Tools**: Click the settings panel (three horizontal bars) in your Nightscout website and select "Admin Tools"
2. **Create Token**: Click "Add New Subject" and choose the appropriate role:
   - **`readable`**: Read-only access (recommended for this app)
   - **`careportal`**: Can view and make treatment entries
   - **`admin`**: Full access
3. **Copy Token**: Use the generated token string for authentication

_Note: If you change your API_SECRET, all tokens will change and need to be updated._
